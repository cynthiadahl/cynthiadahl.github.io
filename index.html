            <h2>My Locker...</h2>
            <p><i>Date Posted: July 20, 2023</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>I never cleaned out my locker on the 2nd floor after finishing Form. Maybe because it was on the bottom row it went unnoticed. I took Form my second year, so I ended up having that locker in the building for most of my sophomore year and junior and senior years. It was great for leaving materials for projects in once I got into some of my electives and capstone.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It was even better for holding all the cool ATLAS swag that I stole from Operations and In-House. I just wish I hadn't forgotten about it in the rush of graduating and moving out of my house. If I remember correctly, it was a blue lock. The passcode should still still be the same... good think I left reminders around ATLAS for the three numbers.</p>

            <h2>The Worst Seat in the Building</h2>
            <p><i>Date Posted: September 29, 2021</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>I just got done with the worst class I've ever had. Normally I love MIT with Annie -- like sit in the front -- but today I showed up a little late and I had to sit towards the back of the room.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What I didn't realize was that I was sitting in the worst seat in the room! I got blasted by sound because I was right underneath two speakers. It's been like 2 hours since class ended, and I still can't hear out of my left year!
            <br>
            <p>The only way I got through it was by drawing on the desk attached to my seat.</p>
