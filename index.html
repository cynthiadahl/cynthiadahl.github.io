            <h2>My Locker...</h2>
            <p><i>Date Posted: July 20, 2023</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>I never cleaned out my locker on the 2nd floor after finishing Form. Maybe because it was on the bottom row it went unnoticed. I took Form my second year, so I ended up having that locker in the building for most of my sophomore year and junior and senior years. It was great for leaving materials for projects in once I got into some of my electives and capstone.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It was even better for holding all the cool ATLAS swag that I stole from Operations and In-House. I just wish I hadn't forgotten about it in the rush of graduating and moving out of my house. If I remember correctly, it was a blue lock. The passcode should still still be the same... good think I left reminders around ATLAS for the three numbers.</p>

            <h2>Painting on the Loading Dock</h2>
            <p><i>Date Posted: April 10, 2023</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Gosh, I can't wait for this project to be done. The painting is taking forever, and the loading dock is a really boring place to hang out compared to the rest of the building. My group and I have started to bring beers out with us. We don't want to get in trouble, so we hide the empties behind one of the recycling bins. Usually, the one on the far right. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I don't think there are any cameras out here, but if there are, I hope they don't check them before I graduate in a few weeks!</p>

            <h2>The Slowest Elevator West of the Mississippi</h2>
            <p><i>Date Posted: October 01, 2022</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>I was in a rush and was dragging around a lot of material today, so I took the elevator to go downstairs to the equipment checkout room on floor 1B. Wouldn't you know it, the elevator got stuck with me in it!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I didn't have any service, so I was stuck in there for a good 40 minutes. It might sound overdramatic, but I had enough time to write a last will and testament (I mean, come on, I was freaking out!). When the elevator started moving again, I decided to hide it somewhere it would be out of the way in the elevator as a joke.</p>

            <h2>The Worst Seat in the Building</h2>
            <p><i>Date Posted: September 29, 2021</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>I just got done with the worst class I've ever had. Normally I love MIT with Annie -- like I sit in the front -- but today I showed up a little late and I had to sit towards the back of the room.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What I didn't realize was that I was sitting in the worst seat in the room! I got blasted by sound because I was right underneath two speakers. It's been like 2 hours since class ended, and I still can't hear out of my left ear, and I can feel my brain still vibrating from the speaker behind me!
            <br>
            <p>The only way I got through it was by drawing on the desk attached to my seat. Maybe it will serve as a good warning for the next unfortunate soul to sit in that seat!</p>
